## Design

### Font 
I kept the font styling simple using two fonts. I Used Google Font Awesome to select my chosen font and apply them to my website.
I used Roboto font style for any message such recipes method, recipe title and welcome message because it's a simple and easy
read. I used Petit Formal Script' for the title such navbar and categories title, to make the website more visually appealing.

### Colours
I used a maximumof three colours for my website, which where green, dark grey and white. I only used three colours to give my 
website a cleaner look and make it flow well. I used green for the navbar and footer. i choose green because my website is 
vegan site and that's mostly a plant based diet. I used white for my navbar titles, and i used dark grey for the rest of the
fonts.Also made my catgory dropdow gree to keep with theme. The colours on my website were consistent and minimal.

### Navbar 
The navbar consists of a Recipes dropdown list showing all the recipe categories, Home, Login and Sign Up. When you 
login, the Login is removed, and Logout, Add Your Recipes and Profile can be viewed.
The side nav on the mobile device appears on the right.


### Home Page 
The home page consists of a picture of a vegan dish with a welcome message, welcoming everyone to the page. They're also a
search bar for searching recipes of your choice. Above the search, there's a message encouraging you to sign up. 
Underneath are four meal categories along with a picture of a meal from said category. If you click a category name,
it should take you the recipes from that category.

### Login and Sign Up Page 
Both pages are identical and only differ in the instructions given to tell you to either login or sign up when entering your 
details on the form. The login page has a link the redirects you to the sign-up page if you're not a member and the Sign-Up 
page vice versa. If you log in with incorrect details, a message will flash telling you. When you're signing up if the username
you've typed is already taken a message will flash informing you.

### Profile Page 
When you log in, you're taken to your profile page and the profile stores any recipes that you've already created. However 
if you do not have any recipes, the profile page is empty and only show Username's Profile Title at the top.

### Add Your Recipes Page
This page allows you to upload your recipes on the site. There's a form to fill,  with text areas such as recipe name, description,
method etc. When you've finished, you can upload the recipe. The recipe saved in your profile page
